# üíæ SprocketCalc
SprocketCalc is intended to help constructors in game "Sprocket" to create designs based on blueprints. 
# ‚öôÔ∏è Current Version
Currently program only calculates scale factors of transforming blueprint pixel dimension to real values in millimeters.
# ‚ùî What to expect from this project?
The final version of this project is going to have a lot more options and is going to be streamlined to quick use.
1. Program will open desired file in separate window.
2. Program will ask user to mark certain points on blueprint.
3. Program will calculate all of the possible values that can be used in game, provided that all the necesarry points were marked.
4. Program's default output is terminal window, however there are plans to introduce usage of txt and csv files.
